## Data sources

[**American Community Survey**](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)

The American Community Survey is an ongoing survey program of the U.S. Census Bureau. The ACS collects information about the nationâ€™s social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics on an annual basis. This information provides the most-up-to-date estimates between decennial censuses.

This section uses data from one ACS table:

* **Table B25042**: Tenure by Bedrooms

The most recent data used for this section are the **2015-2019 5-year estimates**. These estimates average all survey responses across this period to increase sample sizes and reduce margins of error.
