The dashboards on this page include data on median gross rent and the distribution of
gross rent for renter-occupied housing units in Virginia from 2010 to 2020. 


## Median gross rent

Gross rent is defined as contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of
utilities such as electricity, gas, and water/sewer and fuels such as oil or kerosene. 

The median gross rent helps determine the typical rent value in a community. Using the
median prevents the affects that outliers, like a few high-end luxury rental units, may 
have on an average rent. 

Data is available at the state, CBSA, and locality level.

<br><br>
To accurately compare dollar values across time, values need to be converted to a consistent dollar value. This is because the value of the dollar changes across time. One hundred dollars five years ago is not the same as \$100 today due to changes in the price of goods, [inflation and deflation](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/24/18080392/inflation-definition-and-explanation).

We adjust the dollar value of median rent to the year in which data is most recently available utilizing the [Consumer Price Index: All Items Less Shelter](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUUR0000SA0L2).

## Rent distribution

Communities benefit from having an assortment of rental options to meet the need of 
households of all incomes. The distribution of gross rent can help show whether a 
community has a balanced number of rental units at varying prices, or if a community 
is starting to skew towards a high-end rental market. 

Data is available at the state, CBSA, and locality level.
