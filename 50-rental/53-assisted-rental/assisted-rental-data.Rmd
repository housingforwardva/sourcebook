# Data sources

### National Housing Preservation Database (NHPD) {-}

The National Housing Preservation Database (NHPD) is a collaboration between the
Public and Affordable Housing Research Corporation (PAHRC) and the National Low 
Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC). The database was created in 2011 and provides an
address-level inventory of federally assisted rental housing across the nation.

Data is sourced directly from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

Data is updated on a tri-annual basis.
