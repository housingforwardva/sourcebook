The dashboards on this page break down population data by age groups. The amounts and relative shares of children, young adults, middle-age adults, and seniors within a community all significantly impact its different housing needs.
<br>
<br>

## Population by age group

This dashboard shows the current population broken down into ten age groups. This data is from the 2019 release of the Census Bureau's Population Estimates Program. Total population counts by age groups from the 2020 Census will be available later in 2022.

Data is available at the state, CBSA, and locality level.

Data is available at the state, CBSA, and locality level.
