## Data Sources

Household income is used throughout Sourcebook to help analyze affordability
across Virginia. The main source for this data is the American Community Survey (ACS), which provides median household income by tenure, race/ethnicity, and
age group. Helpful sometimes is a distribution of household incomes
by tenure.

The following tables from ACS are pulled:

* B25119 - Median Household Income by Tenure
* B19013 - Median Household Income 
  + Append letters B-I for race and ethnicity
* B19049 - Median Household Income by Age of Householder
* 
  


## Data collection





```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
