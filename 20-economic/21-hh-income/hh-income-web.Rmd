For most socioeconomic data, medians are preferred over means to show the average value for a given sample. Because medians represent the literal "middle" value, they are less influenced by outliers than means. This is important for household income, because a small number of very wealthy individuals could inflate the mean household income for a given community. 

Interpreting medians is straightforward. For example, a county with a median household income of $75,000 has one half of all households earning below that amount, while the other half earns more.

## Data sources

[**American Community Survey**](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) (ACS)

The American Community Survey is an ongoing survey program of the U.S. Census Bureau. The ACS collects information about the nationâ€™s social, economic, housing, and demographic characteristics on an annual basis. This information provides the most-up-to-date estimates between decennial censuses.

This section uses data from four ACS tables:

* **Table B25119**: Median Household Income the Past 12 Months by Tenure
* **Table B25010**: Tenure by Household Income
* **Table B19049**: Median Household Income by Age of Householder
* **Table B19031**: Median Household Income (iterations by race and ethnicity)

The most recent data used for this section are the **2016-2020 5-year estimates**. These estimates average all survey responses across this period to increase sample sizes and reduce margins of error. Data from the previous 5-year estimates are also used as a baseline to show change over time.
